# Unsupervised-leakage-detection
This repository is for the implementation and demonstration of two new unsupervised leakage detection methods. Both method are similar modifications to the matrix- and tensor- decomposition methods NMF and PARAFAC. The modification involves the additional constraint to a single factor or component to introduce our knowledge of the behaviour of leakages into the optimization of these models.
